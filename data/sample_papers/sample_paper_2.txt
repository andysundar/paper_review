Title: Graph Neural Networks for Recommendation Systems

Abstract:
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for recommendation systems. This work presents GCNRec, a novel graph convolutional approach that models user-item interactions as a bipartite graph. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MovieLens and Amazon datasets with 20% improvement over collaborative filtering baselines.

Introduction:
Recommendation systems are crucial for modern e-commerce and media platforms. Traditional approaches like matrix factorization suffer from data sparsity. Recent advances in Graph Neural Networks show promise for capturing complex user-item relationships. We introduce GCNRec, which uses multi-hop graph convolutions to aggregate neighbor information. This approach naturally handles cold-start problems through graph structure.

Methodology:
We design a graph convolutional network with:
1. Bipartite user-item graph construction: Each interaction creates an edge
2. Message passing: Aggregate information from 2-hop neighbors
3. Attention mechanism: Learn edge weights dynamically
4. Ranking loss: Use BPR loss for pairwise ranking

The model trains on 100M user-item pairs using SGD with learning rate 0.01. We employ early stopping on validation set.

Results:
GCNRec achieves NDCG@10 of 0.642 on MovieLens (vs 0.567 for SVD++). On Amazon, recall@20 improves to 0.389 (vs 0.342 for EASE). Performance is consistent across multiple splits. Ablation studies confirm importance of attention mechanism (2% improvement).

Conclusion:
Graph neural networks effectively model recommendation problems. Future work includes temporal dynamics and heterogeneous graphs.
